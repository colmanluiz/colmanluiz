# 👋 Hi, I'm Luiz Henrique Colman  

🚀 Fullstack Software Engineer | AI Enthusiast  

I’m a developer passionate about building scalable systems and integrating **AI into real-world products**.  
With experience in **Node.js, TypeScript, React, NestJS, and Ruby on Rails**, I’ve worked on platforms with **millions of users** and designed AI-powered solutions like chatbots and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.  

Currently, I’m focusing on:  
- **Generative AI & LLM Applications** (RAG pipelines, observability, token optimization)  
- **Scalable Backend Architectures** (NestJS microservices, Kafka, PostgreSQL)  
- **Modern Frontend Development** (React, Next.js, shadcn/ui)  
- **Learning Go** and exploring concurrency, channels, and system design
