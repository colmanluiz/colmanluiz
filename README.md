# 🔥 Featured Projects

## 1️⃣ Task Management System (Microservices Architecture)
**Node.js, NestJS, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, WebSockets, Docker**

A full-stack task management platform built using a microservices architecture.

- API Gateway + independently deployable services
- JWT authentication
- Asynchronous communication with RabbitMQ
- Real-time updates via WebSockets
- Dockerized multi-service environment
- Reduced local setup complexity by ~70%

This project demonstrates distributed systems design, service isolation, and scalable backend architecture.
