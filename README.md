# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Luiz Colman

I'm a **Software Developer** passionate about building smart, scalable, and modern web applications. My main focus is on combining **LLMs** and **AI tools** with robust **backend architecture**, and clean **frontend interfaces** when needed. I enjoy turning technical challenges into polished, reliable solutions.

Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve worked with:

- **Languages & Frameworks:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js, NestJS, React, Next.js, Ruby on Rails  
- **AI & LLM Stack:** OpenAI API, LangChain, Whisper, Langfuse, Pinecone, MongoDB Atlas Vector Search, pgvector  
- **Data & Infra:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Docker, Kafka, PrismaORM, AWS (S3/EC2)
