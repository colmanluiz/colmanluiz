## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [News Article Agent](https://github.com/colmanluiz/news-article-agent)

A RAG-based query-response system built with Node.js, TypeScript, Kafka ingestion, HTML scraping, OpenAI embeddings, and MongoDB Atlas Vector Search. Exposes a `/agent` endpoint that returns concise answers with source metadata. Includes Docker setup, streaming responses, and Langfuse observability.

### RAG-Powered Travel Guide API 🌍🧠

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for intelligent travel recommendations using:

- 🗺️ Geospatial search with MongoDB Atlas
- 🤖 OpenAI embeddings & GPT-4o
- 🔍 Vector similarity search

### Real-Time Collaborative Todo App (Concept)

Full-stack application demonstrating WebSocket-based real-time updates: React frontend, Node.js WebSocket server, NestJS gateways, and Redis adapter for scaling. Features user presence, task syncing, and horizontal scaling via clustering.
